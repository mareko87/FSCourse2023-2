The browser’s viewport is that area of the browser in which website content is displayed. The ability to measure that area is very useful, as it makes once difficult tasks easy — such as setting an element’s height to that of the browser window.

The Units and Their Meaning

Let’s first look at what these units mean.

    vh      - stands for viewport height. 
    This unit is based on the height of the viewport. 
    A value of 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height. 
    A value of 100vh is equal to 100% of the viewport height.
    1vw     - stands for viewport width. 
    This unit is based on the width of the viewport. 
    A value of 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
    vmin    - stands for viewport minimum. 
    This unit is based on the smaller dimension of the viewport. 
    If the viewport height is smaller than the width, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport height. Similarly, if the viewport width is smaller than the height, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.
    vmax    - stands for viewport maximum. 
    This unit is based on the larger dimension of the viewport. 
    If the viewport height is larger than the width, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of viewport height. Similarly, if the viewport width is larger than the height, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.

Some example values

Let’s see what the value of these units will be in different situations:

    - If the viewport is 1200px wide and 1000px high, the value of 10vw will be 120px and the value of 10vh will be 100px. Since the width of the viewport is greater than its height, the value of 10vmax will be 120px and the value of 10vmin will be 100px.
    - If the device is now rotated so that the viewport becomes 1000px wide and 1200px high, the value of 10vh will be 120px and the value of 10vw will be 100px. Interestingly, the value of 10vmax will still be 120px, because it will now be determined based on the height of the viewport. Similarly, the value of 10vmin will still be 100px.
    - If you resize the browser window so that the viewport becomes 1000px wide and 800px high, the value of 10vh will become 80px and the value of 10vw will become 100px. Similarly, the value of 10vmax will become 100px and the value of 10vmin will become 80px.

At this point, viewport units may sound similar to percentages. However, they’re very different. In the case of percentages, the width or height of the child element is determined with respect to its parent.
